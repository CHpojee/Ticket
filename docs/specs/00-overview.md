# 00 — System Overview & Architecture

## Purpose
**Internal IT Support** is an internal ticketing system with a formal approval cycle.
It lets employees raise IT tickets, routes them through an approval workflow, records a
complete audit trail, notifies stakeholders by email on every state change, and gives
admins dashboards, reports, and user management.

## Actors
| Actor      | Description                                                        |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requestor  | Any authenticated user who creates and later closes their tickets. |
| Approver   | A user (non-restricted for the category) who approves/rejects.     |
| Admin      | userId **1001**; manages users and restrictions.                   |

## Core domain objects
- **User** — login identity (`userId`, `password`, `name`).
- **TicketCategory** — `SR`, `DB`, `MR`, `BW`, `IR`.
- **UserRestriction** — bars a user from acting on a category (seed: 1003 → DB).
- **Ticket** — the work item; moves through the status lifecycle.
- **AuditLog** — immutable record of every mutation.

## High-level flow
```
Requestor drafts (New) ──submit──▶ For Approval
For Approval ──approve──▶ In Process ──resolve──▶ Done/Resolved ──close(by requestor)──▶ Closed
For Approval ──reject──▶ Rejected ──resubmit──▶ For Approval
For Approval ──need info──▶ For Additional Info ──resubmit──▶ For Approval
```

## Cross-cutting rules
- **Audit trail**: every create/update/transition writes an `AuditLog` row
  (who, what, when, old→new). See [03-audit-trail.md](03-audit-trail.md).
- **Email**: every state change enqueues a notification. See
  [04-email-notification.md](04-email-notification.md).
- **Restrictions**: services call `assertAllowed(userId, categoryCode)` before any
  category-specific action. See [02-user-maintenance.md](02-user-maintenance.md).

## API conventions
- Base path `/api`. JSON only. JWT bearer auth except `/api/auth/login`.
- Errors returned as `ErrorResponse { timestamp, status, error, message, path }`.
- Standard codes: `400` validation, `401` unauthenticated, `403` restriction/role,
  `404` not found, `409` illegal state transition.
